## 🌟 What is Gomoku Protocol?  
Gomoku Protocol is a **fully on-chain game**, where the entire game logic is embedded in smart contracts—eliminating the need for centralized game servers.  

## 🔥 Why "Protocol"?  
- **Game Composability** – Developers can build new frontends or introduce custom rules on top of the existing smart contract.  
- **Decentralized & Transparent** – Every move is recorded immutably on the blockchain.  
- **Account Abstraction (AA) Wallets** – Players can create **ERC-6551** wallets to store winnings and even trade accounts **without private keys**.
